## Logisim circuits
A series of projects developed in Logisim that show how we can use circuits to understand the relation between hardware components and logic systems.
Each topic regards a special topic: logic gates, turing machine and turing machine with tty.

# 1. Logic gates using MOSFET transistors
MOSFET transistors behave like switches controlled by the value placed on their gate, signal w in the example on the left. The P-type transistor closes with gate=0 and opens with gate=1. The N-type transistor behaves the opposite way, closing with gate=1 and opening with gate=0.

Transistor, Constant, Power and Ground have been used to create the system regarding MOSFET models on the Logisim design sheet. 

# 2. Turing machine
# 3. Turing Machine with tty
 Basic project developed in Logisim that displays words on a TTY using a Turing Machine circuit.
